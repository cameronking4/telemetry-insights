# Introduction

**Incident Triage** (`@devinnn/incident-triage`) is an npm package that turns production alerts into AI-driven triage sessions. You get a root-cause report and optional patch/telemetry PRs—all with a human in the loop.

## Who It's For

- **Platform / SRE teams** that want to cut time-to-root-cause without handing over remediation to automation.
- **Product teams** that use Prometheus, Vercel, GitHub Actions, or PostHog and want one place to trigger triage from any of them.
- **Anyone** who wants to try the loop with **fixtures first**—no Prometheus or live app required.

## How It Works (High Level)

1. **Trigger** — A webhook hits your server (Prometheus, deploy, PostHog, or GitHub), or you run the CLI with a fixture or demo.
2. **Normalize** — We parse the payload into a single `IncidentPayload`, fetch recent commits (git or GitHub API), and load logs (fixture file or future adapter).
3. **Package** — We build one `evidence.json` with incident metadata, commits, diff summary, and log entries, then upload it to Devin.
4. **Devin** — A session runs a deterministic triage playbook and returns structured output: root cause hypothesis, confidence, suggested action (patch / rollback / investigate), and missing telemetry.
5. **Outputs** — We write a markdown report to disk and, if configured, Devin can open a patch PR and/or telemetry PR (you approve).

## Key Principles

- **Structured payloads only** — No live telemetry pipe; we work with what you send (webhooks, fixtures).
- **Human always approves** — No auto-merge; reports and PRs are for review.
- **Fixture-first POC** — Validate the loop with baked scenarios before connecting real systems.

## What's Included

- **CLI** — `validate`, `run --demo`, `run --fixture`, `run --payload`, `status`, `webhook-server`.
- **Webhook server** — `POST /webhook/prometheus`, `/webhook/deploy`, `/webhook/posthog`, `/webhook/github` (native GitHub events for deployment_status, check_run, workflow_run).
- **Config** — `incident-triage.yaml` for Devin, signals, services, normalizer, and outputs.
