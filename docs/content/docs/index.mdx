# Incident Triage

**Turn production alerts into AI-driven triage.** One flow: webhook or fixture → structured evidence → Devin session → root-cause report and optional patch/telemetry PRs. Human always approves. No auto-merge.

## Why Incident Triage?

MTTR is dominated by **discovery and context-gathering**. Engineers spend 30+ minutes pulling logs, diffs, and dashboards before they can hypothesize. By then, the incident may have self-healed or gotten worse.

We compress that loop:

1. **Signal** — Prometheus, PostHog, deploy failures, or GitHub (deployment_status, check_run, workflow_run).
2. **Normalize** — Fetch commits, logs, package into a single evidence bundle.
3. **Devin** — Run a deterministic triage playbook; structured output: root cause, confidence, suggested action, telemetry gaps.
4. **Outputs** — Markdown report, optional patch PR and telemetry PR (Devin opens them; you approve).

**POC-first.** Ship with fixtures. Validate the loop before wiring real Prometheus. No production traffic required.

## What You Get

- **Structured evidence** — One JSON attachment (incident + commits + logs) for Devin.
- **Deterministic playbook** — Identify services, correlate commits and logs, propose root cause and action.
- **Human in the loop** — Reports and PRs for review; no auto-merge.
- **Event-driven** — Webhook server as primary trigger; GitHub Action optional.
