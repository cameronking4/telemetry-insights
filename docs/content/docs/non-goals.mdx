# Non-Goals

We explicitly **do not** do the following for the MVP. This keeps scope clear and avoids over-promising.

## No real-time telemetry ingestion

We do not run a live pipeline that ingests metrics, traces, or logs in real time. We work from **structured payloads** you send (webhooks) or from **fixtures**. If you want triage triggered by a Prometheus alert, you send us the webhook payload when the alert fires.

## No auto-remediation or auto-merge

We do not apply patches or merge PRs automatically. Devin can propose patches and open PRs; **humans approve and merge**. This avoids liability and keeps control with the team.

## No built-in logs providers (Datadog, Loki, etc.)

We define a **logs adapter interface** and ship a **file-based adapter** (fixtures or user-placed files). We do not implement Datadog, Grafana Loki, or CloudWatch in the MVP. Those can be added later as separate adapters.

## No Slack/Jira in MVP

Posting summaries to Slack or creating Jira tickets is out of scope for the first version. The primary outputs are the markdown report and optional GitHub PRs. Slack/Jira can be v2.

## No dashboard generation

We do not generate or host dashboards. We support an optional **dashboard URL template** in config (e.g. Grafana) so you can point triage at existing dashboards; we don't create them.

## No dry-run mode

We removed `--dry-run` from the CLI. If you want to inspect the evidence without calling Devin, you can run the normalizer yourself or add a custom script; the shipped CLI focuses on the full run path.

## No automatic PR creation by the app

**Devin** creates PRs (patch and telemetry) when the playbook and config allow it. This codebase does **not** use Octokit to create PRs itself; we pass repo context and intent in the prompt, and Devin opens PRs. So "we" don't create PRs—Devin does, and we parse the session result for the PR URL.

Summarized: we optimize for **fast, human-approved triage with a single evidence bundle and clear outputs**, not for real-time pipelines, auto-merge, or built-in integrations to every observability tool.
