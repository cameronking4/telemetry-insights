# Outputs

After a Devin session completes, we produce a **markdown report** and optionally surface **PR links** that Devin opened. We do not create PRs ourselves.

## Triage report (markdown)

- **Location:** `config.outputs.reportPath/<incident_id>.md` (default: `.incident-triage/reports/`).
- **Content:** Rendered from the session’s structured output:
  - Summary (status, impacted services, root cause hypothesis, confidence, suggested action)
  - Devin session URL
  - PR URL (if any)
  - Missing telemetry (list)
  - Telemetry improvements (if any)

We create the report directory if it doesn’t exist and write one file per incident.

## Pull requests (by Devin)

- **Patch PR** — Proposed fix for the incident. Devin opens it when the playbook and config allow it (`outputs.createPatchPr`). We only parse and log `pr.url` from the session.
- **Telemetry PR** — Observability improvements (counters, spans, logs). Same idea: Devin may open it when `outputs.createTelemetryPr` is true; we surface the URL.

We **do not** use Octokit in this repo to create branches or PRs. Devin has repo context from the prompt and creates PRs; we display the link in the CLI and in the report.

## Human review

- **requireHumanReview** in config is a flag for documentation/intent: all outputs are for human review. We never auto-merge.

## Optional future outputs

- **Slack** — Webhook POST with summary + report/PR links (not in MVP).
- **Jira** — Create issue with summary (not in MVP).

Current scope: **report on disk + PR link(s) in CLI and report.**
